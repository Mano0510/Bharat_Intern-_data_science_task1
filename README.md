📌 Introduction:-

A Natural Language Processing with SMS Data to predict whether the SMS is Spam/Ham with various ML Algorithms like multinomial-naive-bayes,logistic regression,svm,decision trees to compare accuracy and using various data cleaning and processing techniques like PorterStemmer,CountVectorizer,TFIDF Vetorizer,WordnetLemmatizer.
It is implemented using LSTM and Word Embeddings to gain accuracy of 97.84%.

## ✔❌Accuracy ❌✔:-
| Text Preprocessing Type              | Logistic Regression | Multinomial NB | Support Vector Machine  | Decision Tree |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| TFIDF Vectorizer + PorterStemmer     | 96.68%              | 97.30%         | 98.47%                  | 96.68%        |
